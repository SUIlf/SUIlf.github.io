Professor Sriraam Natarajan is the director for [THE CENTER FOR MACHINE LEARNING](https://cs.utdallas.edu/cmachinelearning/) at UTD. 
The purpose for this centre is to foster excellent research and development of machine learning algorithms motivated by challenges from real world domains ranging from precision health to natural language understanding, from biology to social network analysis.
The core team consists of researchers whose expertise lie in relational models, probabilistic modeling, combinatorial optimization, active learning, logic-based learning, human-in-the-loop learning, reinforcement learning, supervised learning and data mining.
