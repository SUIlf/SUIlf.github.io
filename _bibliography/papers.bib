      abstract={Quantum Computers offer an intriguing challenge in modern Computer Science. With the inevitable physical limitations to Moore's Law, quantum hardware provides avenues to solve grander problems faster by utilizing Quantum Mechanical properties at subatomic scales. These futuristic devices will likely never replace traditional HPC, but rather work alongside them to perform complex tasks, utilizing the best of decades of HPC and quantum computing research. We leverage the capabilities of scientific workflows to make traditional HPC and Quantum Computers work together. To demonstrate this capability, we implemented three algorithms: Grover's Search Algorithm, Shor's Factoring Algorithm, and a 4-node Traveling Salesman Algorithm. The algorithms' implementation and generated inputs are sent from ORNL HPC to IBMQ, the algorithms run on IBMQ, and the results return. The entire process is automated as a workflow by encoding it into the Parsl parallel scripting and workflow platform.}
