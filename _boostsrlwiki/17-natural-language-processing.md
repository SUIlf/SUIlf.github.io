### Overview

Natural language processing is generally a hard task for methods which ignore the relations between sentences and words, and require careful feature construction to work effectively. We focus on preserving these relations while using BoostSRL as the learning and inference engine.

"Financial NLP" is an information extraction project for finding three features in SEC Form S-1 documents, notably the number of [primary shares](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primaryoffering.asp), [secondary shares](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp), and [overallotments](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overallotment.asp). This project is split into two parts: the information extraction package and the terminal interface to make it easier to interact with. Furthermore, it is a testbed for providing advice to the algorithms through markov logic networks.
