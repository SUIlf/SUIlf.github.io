Hello, I am a Junior year Electrical Engineering student at Texas A&M University, College Station. I will be graduating in Spring 2025 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, and I look to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering afterward. 

One of the main subjects I have found fascinating is the seemingly endless potential of quantum computing. While unlikely to replace classical computers or supercomputers, these still-in-development devices have the potential to upend numerous fields, such as cybersecurity, medicine, and material sciences. While quantum software is already sufficiently advanced, the hardware is years if not decades behind the most ambitious goals of quantum computing, offering an immense opportunity to my generation to create machines that can exhibit Quantum Advantage.
