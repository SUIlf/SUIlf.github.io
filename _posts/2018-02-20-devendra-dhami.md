I am currently working on the problem of drug-drug interactions using structural data from the molecules and chemical reaction pathways which exist between interacting medications. Most of the work in this area has existed in the area of natural language processing where interactions are inferred through mining the medical literature. We take a non-conventional approach by considering the structure of the drugs themselves.

This method not only predicts interactions between different drugs but discovers new potential interactions, thereby exploiting deeper structures and drug features.
